# About This Project
### Motivation for Project
This group project was done for the Web and Mobile Development course and served as backend app to the accompanying Android and iOS apps for their respective courses.


## UWIber
UWIber is a fictional company that provides taxi service to the students of the University of the West Indies, Mona. Students have a variety of options to be transported to and from the campus, in and around the area of Kingston and St. Andrew in Jamaica.

The company consists of independently contracted drivers and registered students who are able to access the many facilities this android application has to offer. 
## UWIber Admin
UWIber Admin is a web app that provides CRUD functionality to the administrators of UWIber. It allows the administrator user to see an overall dashboard of the statistics of the app, see the list of drivers, clients and rides, and be able to create and update a client or driver’s details right from the app, no backend needed.

UWIber Admin was built using the Python web framework Django. 

### Features include

### Intended Use
The UWIber Admin is used only by system administrators. The users who qualify to be administrators are all developers, testers and managers. Drivers and customers should not have access to this section of the system. UWIber Admin’s intention is to provide a clean and effective CRUD interface to users with administrative privileges.
The Web app will also provide APIs that will allow mobile devices to perform CRUD operations on behalf of the clientele.
